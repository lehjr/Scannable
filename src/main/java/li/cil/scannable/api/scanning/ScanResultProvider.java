/**
 * Interface for a scan result provider.
 * <p>
 * Provide this as a capability in an item so that it can be installed in the
 * scanner. Once installed, it will be queried when the scanner is used.
 * <p>
 * This is essentially just a fancy {@link Iterator} with support for partial
 * advancement so as to allow distributing scan workload over multiple ticks.
 * <p>
 * If your implementation is not that computationally expensive, it is fine to
 * just collect all scan results in the first {@link #computeScanResults(Consumer)}
 * call.
 * <p>
 * Otherwise, the implementation should prepare for spread out collection of
 * results in {@link #initialize(PlayerEntity, Collection, Vec3d, float, int)},
 * over the specified number of ticks. Each tick until the scan is complete,
 * {@link #computeScanResults(Consumer)} will be called, in which the
 * implementation should add results collected this tick to the passed
 * collection. It is the responsibility of the implementation to ensure that
 * all results have been added by the end of the last tick's call to
 * {@link #computeScanResults(Consumer)}.
 * <p>
 * Note that all of the scanning behavior is <em>client side only</em>, none
 * of these methods will ever be called on the server. However, the capability
 * must also be <em>reported</em> as present on the server so that both sides
 * can detect if there are any scan providers installed and ignore the scan if
 * there are not. The capability does not in fact have to be gettable, the
 * server only does a <code>hasCapability</code> check.
